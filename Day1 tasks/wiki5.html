    <h1>Vibhishana:</h1><hr><br>
    <p>Vibhishana (Sanskrit: विभीषण, romanized: Vibhīṣaṇa, lit. 'formidable')[3] is the younger brother of Ravana, the King of Lanka, in the ancient Indian epic Ramayana.[4] Though a rakshasa himself, Vibhishana turned his back on Ravana, and defected to Rama's side, owing to his dharma.[5] After Rama defeated Ravana, the former crowned Prince Vibhishana as the King of Lanka before returning to Ayodhya.</p><br>
