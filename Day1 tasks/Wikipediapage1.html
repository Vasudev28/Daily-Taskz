     <h2>The Seven Chiranjivis</h2><hr>
     <ul>
        <li><p><a href="wiki2.html"><u>Veda Vyasa</u></a>: The sage who composed the Mahabharata. He represents erudition and wisdom. He is the son of sage Parashara and Satyavati, a fisherwoman.[5] He is also the great-grandson of the sage Vashishtha. He was born towards the end of Dvapara Yuga, and saw the initial phase of Kali Yuga</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="wiki3.html"><u>Hanuman</u></a>:One of the greatest brahmachari, he served Rama. He is the most ardent vanara devotee of Rama. He stands for selflessness, courage, devotion, intelligence, strength, celibacy and righteous conduct.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="wiki4.html"><u>Parashurama</u></a>: The sixth avatar of Vishnu. He is knowledgeable in all astras, shastras, and divine weapons. The Kalki Purana writes that he will reemerge at the end of time to be the martial guru of Kalki. He will then instruct the final avatar to undertake penance to receive celestial weaponry, required to save mankind during the end times.</p></li>
        <li><p><a href="wiki5.html"><u>Vibishana</u></a>:The brother of Ravana. Vibhishana defected to Rama before his battle with Ravana. He was later crowned the King of Lanka after Ravana was killed by Rama. He stands for righteousness. Vibhishana is not a true Chiranjivi, as his boon of longevity is to remain on the earth only until the end of the Maha Yuga. </p></li>
        <li><p><a href="wiki6.html"><u>Ashwathama</u></a>:The son of Drona. Drona performed many years of severe penance to please Shiva in order to obtain a son who possessed the same valour as the deity. Ashwatthama is the avatar of one of the eleven Rudras. Kripa and he are believed to be the lone survivors still living who had fought in the Kurukshetra War. He is immortal, but Krishna bestowed upon him a curse that "he would live forever but with his body covered with painful sores and ulcers that would never be cured"</p></li>
