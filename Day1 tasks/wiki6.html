    <h1>Ashwathama:</h1><hr><br>
    <p>In the Hindu epic the Mahabharata, Ashwatthama (Sanskrit: Aśvatthāmā) or Drauni is the son of guru Drona and Kripi (sister of Kripa) and he is also a pivotal character in the Mahabharata. The grandson of the sage Bharadwaja, Ashwatthama ruled the northern region of Panchala with Ahichhatra as his capital, being subordinate to the rulers of Hastinapura. He was a Maharathi[1] who fought on the Kaurava side against the Pandavas in the Kurukshetra War. He was cursed by Krishna following the Kurukshetra War for his attempt to end the Pandava lineage after the cessation of hostilities by attempting to murder Uttara's unborn child, Parikshit. He is regarded to be a chiranjivi, an immortal being, who still roams the world with foul-smelling fluids oozing from his form.</p><br>
