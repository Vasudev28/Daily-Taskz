    <h1>Veda Vyasa:</h1><hr><br>
    <p>Vyasa is also regarded by many Hindus as a partial incarnation (Sanskrit: अंशावतार, romanized: aṃśa-avatāra / aṃśāvatāra) of the god Vishnu and the compiler of the mantras of the Vedas into four Vedas, as well as the author of the eighteen Puranas and the Brahma Sutras. He is one of the eight immortals Chiranjīvis, implying he is still alive in the current Kali yuga.</p><br>
    <p>Vyasa's birth name is Krishna Dvaipayana, which possibly refers to his dark complexion and birthplace,[2] although he is more commonly known as "Veda Vyasa" (Veda Vyāsa) as he has compiled the single, eternal Veda into four separate books—Rigveda, Samaveda, Yajurveda and Atharvaveda.</p>
